      <h1>Welcome to my Blog page :) </h1>
      <div>
        Here i try to write about any new technologies that i learn. i also write what i understand from a select few leetcode problems too
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        One thing about this blog page is that i don't need to modify any code to publish a new blog. i can write my blog in a markdown file, since i  use obsidian for making notes, i can just upload the markdown file without needing to change any code. 
      </div>
  </div>

export default Home;
